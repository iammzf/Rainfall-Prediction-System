# Project Title
Rainfall Prediction System using Machine Learning

## Overview
Accurately predicting daily rainfall remains a challenge, with even meteorological departments occasionally producing incorrect forecasts. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of predicting rainfall based on atmospheric factors. Leveraging the strengths of machine learning, this approach aims to address a traditionally complex task that once required significant expertise and manual effort.

## Dependencies
